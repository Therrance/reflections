How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I can see what lines of code was changed.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It's easy to find bugs in code comparing different versions of files.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    With manual choosing it's possible to make mistake choosing too big or too small amount of code to commit.
    With automatically saved versions there are too many versions, and hard to find bug there.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because, in programming one logical change may touch more than one file.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log - to see the list of commits
    git diff - difference between two particular commits


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can rollback to working version any time.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I'll use Git for all my programming projects.
