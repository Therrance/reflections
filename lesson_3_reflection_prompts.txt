When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to share my project with others or work with one codebase on various 
    hosts.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Using auto pulls, it could be some conflicts, if someone else change
    your code.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork - copy from GitHub repo to GitHub repo;
    Clone - copy repo to your local directory;
    Branch - copy within your repository.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It's easier to merge you commits to local copy, than to the remote.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Using common FTP directory, all changes set on Google Doc table. It's definitely easier 
    to use GitHub.
    

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    I'm going to work in master branch when I work with project by myself, when 
    there are more than one contributor you should use various branches.
